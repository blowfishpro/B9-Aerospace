    title = S2W Wide Body Fuselage Adapter LFO
    manufacturer = Tetragon Projects
    description = Adapter for S2 wide body fuselage, version with embedded LFO fuel tanks.. Developed to replace the dated MK2 fuselage system, newest S2 series features large selection of pieces with high-capacity fuel tanks and re-entry heat protection. Every problem from previous generation of fuselages was fixed, from displaced center of mass to sloppily painted thermal protection tiles. Rest assured, new ones are painted over the plastic hull so well you can barely tell them apart from the real thing!
