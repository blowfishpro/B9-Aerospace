    description = Growing tired from being forced to use dozens of old small control surfaces for their increasingly enormous aircraft designs, kerbal engineers came up with a set of larger ones. This stabilator is large enough to flip your entire craft over, making it an absolute necessity for, uh, highly maneuverable designs.
