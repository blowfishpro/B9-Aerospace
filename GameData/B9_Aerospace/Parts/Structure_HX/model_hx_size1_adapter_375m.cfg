    description = CONTAINS 3 SUBTYPES | This part is a reinforced docking port used for in-orbit assembly of large designs. Can be configured for use in multi-port size 2 and size 3 docking assemblies as well as used for simple single-port connections to other size 1 parts. Be aware that HX1-A-375, HX2-A-375 and HX4-A-375 docking ports are not cross-compatible! If you want to dock to a cross-section of a different size, both sides should have identical docking port type: for example, to dock a size 1 spaceship to a size 3 spaceship, the receiving side should be assembled from four type C HX1-A-375 docking ports (not from two HX2-A-375 or one HX4-A-375 docking port!). None of the HX docking ports are compatible with preexisting 3.75m/2.5m/1.25m docking systems.
