    description = RCS thrusters are used to rotate and translate your spacecraft in the absense of other means to do so (control surfaces won't help you turn outside of the atmoshpere and reaction wheels can't help you move to the side). An obvious choice for any sane aerospace engineer, this product has a tremendous advantage over earlier thruster block designs: it looks somewhat nice and hopefully won't produce as much aerodynamic drag as previously used RCS thruster models.
