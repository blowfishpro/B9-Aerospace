    description = RCS thrusters are used to rotate and translate your spacecraft in the absense of other means to do so (control surfaces won't help you turn outside of the atmoshpere and reaction wheels can't help you move to the side). An obvious choice for any sane aerospace engineer, this product has a tremendous advantage over earlier thruster block designs: it looks somewhat nice. Brightest kerbal scientists predict at least 600% decrease in aerodynamic drag in comparison with other thruster blocks by virtue of covering unsigthly mess of pipes and nozzles with a box. Twin nozzle design is another advantage, providing 2% more reliability at a small cost of doubled propellant consumption rate. Or not, it's not like we remember how we rigged the pipes in there.
