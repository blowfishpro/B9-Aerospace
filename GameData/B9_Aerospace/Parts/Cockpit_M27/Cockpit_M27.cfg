    description = Versatile two-seat cockpit for complex vessel designs. The story behind this part is unclear, but it looks like Kerbal engineers were very influenced by some sci-fi flick. Or maybe it's a prop raided straight from the set. Maybe it's even made from plastic, try to check that before attempting reentry. On the bright side, it gives exceptional field of view, can be equipped with forward-facing docking port, and works well as an adapter part in the middle of large ships. Use C125 Axial Adapter reinforced with struts to carry heavy payloads in front of this cockpit without a risk of uncontrollable spinning and rapid unplanned disassembly.
