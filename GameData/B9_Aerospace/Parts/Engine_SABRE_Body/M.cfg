    description = As the air enters the engine at supersonic/hypersonic speeds, it becomes very hot due to compression effects. The high temperatures are traditionally dealt with in jet engines by using heavy copper or nickel based materials, by reducing the engine's pressure ratio, and by throttling back the engine at the higher airspeeds to avoid melting. However, for an SSTO craft, such heavy materials are unusable, and maximum thrust is necessary for orbital insertion at the earliest time to minimize gravity losses. Instead, using a gaseous helium coolant loop, SABRE dramatically cools the air from 1000C down to -150C in a heat exchanger. Just kidding, this knockoff piece probably isn't doing anything.
