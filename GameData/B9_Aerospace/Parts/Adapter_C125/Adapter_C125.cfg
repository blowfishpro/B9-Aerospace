    description = This product was created as response to pilot complaints about imbalanced front mount position on M27 series cockpit. With this adapter, you can now attach as much mass to the front of your ship as you want without experiencing unwanted rotation under thrust. The construction also allows you to maintain vertical field of view, leaving space in front of the cockpit for you to look down right "through" your ship. Consider reinforcing connection to the pod with struts, as small 1.25m mount is prone to breaking under heavy load.
