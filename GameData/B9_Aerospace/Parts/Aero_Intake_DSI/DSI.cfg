    description = This intake operates well in wide range of air speeds thanks to it's ususual geometry consisting of a bumped inner side and a forward-swept inlet cowl, which work together to divert boundary layer airflow away from the aircraft's engine while compressing the air to slow it down from supersonic speed.
