    description = Less intrusive strut connector design. Visible parts serve merely to show the endpoints of structural reinforcement that happens inside the parts. Okay, actually, the strut is just invisible. Made for those of you who think that tying up wings to the fuselage with some steel cables looked a bit weird.
