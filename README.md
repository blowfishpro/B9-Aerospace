# Installation

Unpack everything to the root folder of the game, overwriting already existing GameData and Ships folders.

Source folder contains the source code for the included plugins and is not necessary for the mod to work.

Make sure you have KSP 1.2.2 or higher.

Do *not*, under any circumstances, extract just `GameData/B9_Aerospace/Parts` folder alone, the mod won't work this way.

With a proper installation, you should have multiple new folders in GameData alongside with Squad folder that was there originally.

Do not try to move the part folders anywhere or sort them by category subfolders, that will break resource linking in all configs.

# About

This set of parts vastly expands a selection of parts, in particular with spaceplane components such as new engines, cockpits, wings and fuselage systems.

The style was influenced by futuristic concept art, modern UAV designs, some believable hard sci-fi ideas, DARPA & NASA aerospace research, and by asymmetrical shapes and faceted designs that are nowadays common everywhere from automotive industry to military aircraft.

I have decided not to go overboard with realistic art style or extreme colors: my intention is to make parts which would blend seamlessly with, for example, KW Rocketry pieces.

My textures are hand-painted, I’m avoiding photo-sourced areas or excessive detail like rust.

Everything looks just a little bit cartoony, like a concept art, which, in my opinion, fits nicely with the general art style of KSP (most of the stock part textures were painted too).

Although I’m going for higher fidelity and texture resolution, so don’t expect a 100% match – but I’m fairly satisfied with results and have already built some neat ships using them.

The goal of the project is to fill every empty niche in KSP part selection and to replace every sub-par component with a new part better suited for the role.

# Aerodynamics

While we take pains to ensure the parts are balanced in the stock drag model, most of the testing has been done using FAR.  Parts may not behave ideally under the stock drag system.

For the best possible experience with spaceplanes in Kerbal Space Program, you should install FAR:



## Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR)

Better instruments for flight. RPM-compatible. [forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=77062)



## Part Angle display

See and set the rotations of parts in the editor, and change the fine angle changes from the stock value down all the way down to 0.01 degrees at a time if you need to.

Widely used to create the stock B9 crafts, because 5 degrees is a bit too coarse for planes. [forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=73551)

Altitude, slope, biome and anomaly maps with zoom to help you plan your landings or look for that missing monolith. Supports or is supported by Kethane, Karbonite, KSPi, RPM so you can map all your resources with one system and see it in the cockpit. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=72679)



## Science Alert

Lets you know when you've crossed biome borders so you know to run all those experiments. [forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=69538)



## Space Shuttle Engines

Engines for your SLS/Buran-alikes.

We use the Gimbal plugin from this mod, and its *awesome*. It really does let you build stuff with off-center thrust like the Shuttle Launch System.

Also has some very nice replica main tanks, and utility parts that can trigger staging/action groups based on conditions, there's timers, fuel crossfeed controllers and more. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=51197)



## TAC Fuel Balancer

Automatically balance fuel between tanks, dump fuel, transfer a resource from/to all other tanks, or lock it so resources can't move in or out of it. Highly configurable.

Recommended for any SSTO or plane pilot, it will make keeping your planes balanced as engines draw fuel much easier. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=23808)



## TAC Life Support

Resource needs for your kerbals, for those that want a more realistic space program.

Compatible with USI Kolonization System [forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=37449)



## Toolbar

The original plugin toolbar, and still superior to the one added to stock in 0.24.

While most plugins that can use it include it, its nice to know where to check for the latest version. [forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=55420)



## USI Kolonization System

Parts and plugins targeted specifically at setting up remote bases for your kerbals to live and work in. Uses the Open Resource System like KSPi and Karbonite. Compatible (and recommends) TAC Life Support. [forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=72032)
